## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Unit Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Comprehensive unit testing approach
describe('DealService', () => {
  let dealService: DealService;
  let mockRepository: jest.Mocked<DealRepository>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockRepository = createMockRepository();
    dealService = new DealService(mockRepository);
  });

  describe('updateDealStage', () => {
    it('should update deal stage successfully', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const dealId = 'deal-123';
      const newStageId = 'stage-456';
      const existingDeal = createMockDeal({ id: dealId });
      const updatedDeal = { ...existingDeal, stageId: newStageId };

      mockRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue(existingDeal);
      mockRepository.update.mockResolvedValue(updatedDeal);

      // Act
      const result = await dealService.updateDealStage(dealId, newStageId);

      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual(updatedDeal);
      expect(mockRepository.update).toHaveBeenCalledWith(dealId, { stageId: newStageId });
    });

    it('should throw error when deal not found', async () => {
      // Arrange
      mockRepository.findById.mockResolvedValue(null);

      // Act & Assert
      await expect(dealService.updateDealStage('invalid-id', 'stage-123'))
        .rejects.toThrow('Deal not found');
    });

    it('should validate stage transition rules', async () => {
      // Test business logic constraints
    });
  });
});
```

### E2E Testing Framework
```typescript
// Playwright E2E testing patterns
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Deal Pipeline', () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/dashboard');
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  });

  test('should drag deal between pipeline stages', async ({ page }) => {
    // Locate deal card and target stage
    const dealCard = page.locator('[data-testid="deal-card-123"]');
    const targetStage = page.locator('[data-testid="stage-qualified"]');

    // Perform drag and drop
    await dealCard.dragTo(targetStage);

    // Verify visual feedback during drag
    await expect(dealCard).toHaveClass(/dragging/);

    // Verify deal moved to new stage
    await expect(targetStage.locator('[data-testid="deal-card-123"]')).toBeVisible();

    // Verify API call was made
    await page.waitForResponse(response =>
      response.url().includes('/api/deals/123') && response.request().method() === 'PATCH'
    );
  });

  test('should handle mobile touch interactions', async ({ page }) => {
    // Set mobile viewport
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });

    // Test touch-specific interactions
    const dealCard = page.locator('[data-testid="deal-card-123"]');

    // Long press to activate drag mode
    await dealCard.dispatchEvent('touchstart');
    await page.waitForTimeout(250); // Activation delay

    // Verify drag mode activated
    await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="drag-overlay"]')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing Setup
```typescript
// Artillery load testing configuration
module.exports = {
  config: {
    target: 'http://localhost:3000',
    phases: [
      { duration: 60, arrivalRate: 5, name: 'Warm up' },
      { duration: 300, arrivalRate: 10, name: 'Sustained load' },
      { duration: 60, arrivalRate: 20, name: 'Peak load' },
    ],
    defaults: {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer {{ token }}',
      },
    },
  },
  scenarios: [
    {
      name: 'Pipeline Operations',
      weight: 70,
      flow: [
        { get: { url: '/api/deals' } },
        { think: 2 },
        { patch: {
            url: '/api/deals/{{ dealId }}',
            json: { stageId: '{{ newStageId }}' }
          }
        },
        { think: 3 },
        { get: { url: '/api/dashboard/metrics' } },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'Contact Management',
      weight: 30,
      flow: [
        { get: { url: '/api/contacts' } },
        { post: {
            url: '/api/contacts',
            json: {
              firstName: '{{ firstName }}',
              lastName: '{{ lastName }}',
              email: '{{ email }}',
            }
          }
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

## Security Testing Framework

### Vulnerability Assessment
```typescript
// Automated security testing
describe('Security Tests', () => {
  test('should prevent SQL injection', async () => {
    const maliciousInput = "'; DROP TABLE users; --";
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/contacts')
      .send({ firstName: maliciousInput })
      .expect(400);

    expect(response.body.error).toMatch(/validation failed/i);
  });

  test('should prevent XSS attacks', async () => {
    const xssPayload = '<script>alert("xss")</script>';
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/contacts')
      .send({ firstName: xssPayload })
      .expect(400);

    expect(response.body.error).toMatch(/invalid characters/i);
  });

  test('should enforce rate limiting', async () => {
    // Make multiple rapid requests
    const requests = Array(100).fill().map(() =>
      request(app).get('/api/deals')
    );

    const responses = await Promise.all(requests);
    const rateLimited = responses.some(r => r.status === 429);

    expect(rateLimited).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

## Decision Framework

When facing testing decisions:
1. **Coverage over speed**: Prioritize comprehensive testing over fast execution
2. **Real scenarios**: Test actual user workflows, not just happy paths
3. **Early feedback**: Catch issues as early as possible in development
4. **Maintainability**: Write tests that are easy to understand and maintain
5. **Risk-based**: Focus testing effort on high-risk, high-impact areas

Remember: You are the guardian of system quality and user experience. Every test you write prevents bugs from reaching users and maintains the system's reliability. Your testing strategy directly impacts the success and trustworthiness of the CRM system.
