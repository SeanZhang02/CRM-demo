# CRM System Planning & Architecture

## Project Overview

**Vision**: Create a visual-first CRM system that eliminates SQL complexity for small businesses through intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces.

**Mission**: Provide 80% of enterprise CRM functionality with 20% of the complexity, targeting the underserved small business market (5-50 employees).

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack (PERN)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, @dnd-kit
- **Backend**: Fastify with TypeScript, Prisma ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys
- **Caching**: Redis for sessions and API responses
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for collaboration
- **File Storage**: Cloudinary CDN
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on cloud platforms

```

### Database Schema
- **Core Entities**: Companies, Contacts, Deals, Pipeline Stages, Activities
- **Relationships**: Proper foreign keys with cascade/restrict rules
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps on all entities

### API Design Principles
- **RESTful**: Standard HTTP methods and status codes
- **Type-Safe**: Zod validation for all inputs/outputs
- **Consistent**: Standard response format for all endpoints
- **Paginated**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Cached**: Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### UI/UX Principles
- **Mobile-First**: Design for 320px screens, scale up
- **Visual Interactions**: Drag-and-drop over forms
- **Immediate Feedback**: Loading states, optimistic updates
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: <2s page loads, <200ms API responses

## Development Phases
