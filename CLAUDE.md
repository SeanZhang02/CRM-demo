### üîÑ Project Awareness & Context
- **Always read `CRM_Research_Findings.md`** at the start of a new conversation to understand the project's market research, competitive analysis, and business requirements.
- **Always read `REALISTIC_SOLUTION.md`** to understand the 6-week MVP approach and core architecture decisions.
- **Check `TASK.md`** before starting a new task. If the task isn't listed, add it with a brief description and today's date.
- **Follow the simple, achievable approach** - prioritize immediate value over complex features.
- **Focus on desktop-first design** - optimized for business users on 1024px+ screens with mouse/keyboard interaction.
- **Agent Orchestration**: Follow `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_LAWS.md` for automatic agent coordination during development.

### üß± Code Structure & Modularity
- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.
- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.
  For this CRM project structure:
    - Frontend: `pages/`, `components/`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `types/`
    - API Routes: `pages/api/` (Next.js API routes)
    - Database: `prisma/schema.prisma`, `prisma/migrations/`
    - Shared: `types/`, `utils/`
- **Use TypeScript throughout** for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Keep it simple**: Single repository (frontend + backend in Next.js), no microservices.

### üß™ Testing & Reliability
- **Create tests for core business logic** using Jest for components and API routes.
- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing tests need to be updated. If so, do it.
- **Frontend tests**: Use React Testing Library for component tests.
- **API tests**: Test API routes with supertest or similar.
- **Test structure**:
  - `__tests__/` folders alongside source files
  - Include at least: 1 happy path, 1 edge case, 1 error case
  - Focus on core workflows: CRUD operations, filtering, data relationships

### ‚úÖ Task Completion
- **Mark completed tasks in `TASK.md`** immediately after finishing them.
- Add new sub-tasks discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a "Discovered During Work" section.
- **Follow the 6-week milestone approach** outlined in REALISTIC_SOLUTION.md.

### üìé Style & Conventions
- **Frontend**: TypeScript + Next.js 14+ with App Router, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type-safe database access
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for simple authentication setup
- **Deployment**: Vercel for hosting, Supabase for managed PostgreSQL
- Write **clear component documentation**:
  ```typescript
  /**
   * Visual data table with Airtable-style filtering
   * Replaces complex SQL queries with simple UI interactions
   *
   * @param data - Array of records to display
   * @param columns - Table column definitions
   * @param onFilter - Callback when filters are applied
   */
  interface DataTableProps {
    data: Record<string, any>[]
    columns: ColumnDefinition[]
    onFilter: (filters: Filter[]) => void
  }
  ```

### üìö Documentation & Explainability
- **Update `README.md`** when new features are added or setup steps change.
- **Comment the "why" not the "what"** - focus on business logic and user experience decisions.
- **Document visual filtering patterns** - how we replace SQL with UI interactions.
- When writing complex filtering logic, **add inline comments** explaining the business requirement.

### üß† AI Behavior Rules
- **Never assume missing context. Ask questions if uncertain.**
- **Never hallucinate libraries or frameworks** ‚Äì only use verified npm packages (React, Next.js, Prisma, etc.).
- **Always confirm file paths exist** before referencing them in code.
- **Never delete or overwrite existing code** unless explicitly instructed or part of a task.
- **Focus on simplicity over sophistication** - remember users abandon complex CRMs.
- **Prioritize working functionality over perfect architecture** - follow the MVP approach.

  accessibilityCompliance: { required: true, status: 'BLOCKING' },
  keyboardNavigation: { required: true, status: 'BLOCKING' }
}

// AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT: If any gate fails, immediately activate relevant agent
if (qualityGate.failed) {
  activateAgent(getResponsibleAgent(qualityGate.category), `Fix ${qualityGate.issue}`)
  BLOCK_DEPLOYMENT = true
}
```

    dbQuery: 200,          // ms - activate database-architect immediately
    errorRate: 10          // % - activate testing-qa immediately
  },

  // Optimization needed if exceeded
  warning: {
    apiResponse: 200,      // ms - schedule optimization
    pageLoad: 2000,        // ms - schedule optimization
    dbQuery: 100,          // ms - schedule optimization
    errorRate: 5           // % - schedule review
  }
}

// AUTO-TRIGGER: Check after every significant change
after_every_completion(() => {
  if (performance.exceeds(CRITICAL_THRESHOLDS)) {
    EMERGENCY_RESPONSE(getPerformanceAgents())
  }
})
```
