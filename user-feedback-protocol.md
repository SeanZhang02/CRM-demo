## Feedback Collection Tools

### Quantitative Feedback
```typescript
// Analytics tracking for user behavior
interface UserAnalytics {
  sessionDuration: number
  featuresUsed: string[]
  errorEncountered: boolean
  taskCompletionTime: number
  dropOffPoints: string[]
  mobileVsDesktopUsage: number
}

// In-app feedback widget
const FeedbackWidget = () => (
  <div className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 z-50">
    <button className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-3 rounded-full">
      ðŸ’¬ Feedback
    </button>
  </div>
)
```

### Qualitative Feedback
- **In-app feedback widget**: Quick ratings and comments
- **Post-session surveys**: Detailed satisfaction metrics
- **Follow-up interviews**: Deeper insights 1 week after testing
- **Community forum**: Ongoing feature requests and discussions

### Real-Time Monitoring

## A/B Testing Framework

### Critical Tests to Run
1. **Onboarding Flow**: Guided tour vs self-discovery
2. **Pipeline Layout**: Vertical vs horizontal columns
3. **Mobile Navigation**: Bottom tabs vs hamburger menu
4. **Deal Card Design**: Compact vs detailed information
5. **Color Scheme**: Professional blue vs warm green

### Testing Implementation
```typescript
// Feature flag system for A/B testing
interface FeatureFlags {
  newOnboardingFlow: boolean
  verticalPipeline: boolean
  bottomNavigation: boolean
  compactDealCards: boolean
  warmColorScheme: boolean
}

const useFeatureFlag = (flag: keyof FeatureFlags) => {
  // Return flag value based on user segment
  return featureFlags[flag] && userSegment.includesFlag(flag)
}
```

3. **Technical Effort**: Implementation complexity (Days/Weeks/Months)
4. **Strategic Alignment**: Supports visual-first, mobile-first goals? (Yes/No)
5. **Competitive Advantage**: Differentiates from Salesforce/HubSpot? (Yes/No)

**Decision Matrix**:
- High Impact + Low Effort = Immediate implementation
