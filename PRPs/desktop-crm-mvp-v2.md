## 🚀 KINETIC AGENT ORCHESTRATION INTEGRATION

### Agent-Driven Development Model
```typescript
interface KineticDevelopment {
  // Automatic agent activation based on triggers
  agentActivation: "Triggered by completion events and quality thresholds",

  // Real-time quality enforcement
  qualityGates: "Agent-specific validation before handoffs",

  // Emergency response protocols
  crisisManagement: "Automatic agent mobilization for critical issues",

  // Performance monitoring
