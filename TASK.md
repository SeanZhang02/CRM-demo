- [ ] ESLint/Prettier configured and passing
- [ ] Docker development environment functional
- [ ] Basic test infrastructure ready
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive framework established

### Performance Targets

## üîÑ Daily Standup Notes

### January 20, 2025
- **Completed**: Project documentation review and improvement
- **Today**: Setting up foundational development files and environment
- **Blockers**: None
- **Risks**: Timeline aggressive but manageable with proper coordination

---

## üìù Discovered During Work

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys for scalability
- **Backend**: Fastify instead of Express for better TypeScript support
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ with App Router (not Pages Router)
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit library for mobile compatibility
- **Testing**: Jest (frontend) + Vitest (backend) + Playwright (E2E)

### New Tasks Added
- [ ] Create comprehensive mobile testing protocol
- [ ] Set up user feedback collection system
- [ ] Design agent handoff validation checklists
- [ ] Implement performance budgets in CI/CD

### Lessons Learned
- Multi-agent coordination requires explicit communication protocols
- Mobile-first approach needs enforcement mechanisms
- User validation should be built into development cycles

## Task Guidelines

### Task Management Rules
1. **Always check this file** before starting new work
2. **Add new tasks** discovered during development to "Discovered During Work"
3. **Move completed tasks** to the completed section with date
4. **Break down large tasks** into smaller, actionable items
5. **Estimate effort** and track actual time spent

### Priority Levels
- **P0 - Critical**: Blocking other work, must be done immediately
- **P1 - High**: Important for current phase, should be done this week
- **P2 - Medium**: Nice to have, can be deferred to next week
- **P3 - Low**: Future enhancement, can be deferred to next phase

### Task Format
```
- [ ] Task description (Priority: P1, Estimate: 2 days)
  - Sub-task 1
  - Sub-task 2
  - Acceptance criteria
```

### Definition of Done

- [ ] Code is written and tested
- [ ] Unit tests are created and passing
- [ ] Code review is completed
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Feature is tested on mobile and desktop
